# NekoFetcher

(Not too) Simple plugin to fetch and draw cute anime neko images on in-game maps.

The main idea behind this, is fun and give some anime servers (if they exist) something with they can decorate stuff and have fun with. Although that the main reason of this plugin, you're free of adding it to your server's plugin list independently of what the server is.

Plugin works using the [nekos.life](https://nekos.life) API endpoints to get images, so if you have an outbound firewall add this site.

## Usage

To use the plugin, simply hold a filled map with something in your main hand and use the `/nget` command, an image of a neko will be applied to the map that you can use for decoration purposes.

Main permissions are `nekofetcher.get` (/nekoget) and `nekofetcher.neko` (/neko), the last command is for help and reloading the plugin.

Here's a preview of how the maps looks with images applied in-game:
